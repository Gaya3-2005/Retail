# 🛒 Business Analysis Project – Retail Inventory Optimization  

## 🔹 Project Overview  
This project addresses **retail inventory challenges** such as **overstocking and frequent stockouts**, which lead to lost sales, high carrying costs, and customer dissatisfaction.  

As a **Business Analyst**, I identified the problem, gathered requirements, prepared **BRD & FRD**, designed **process flows (As-Is vs To-Be)**, and proposed a **dashboard** to monitor stock levels and sales performance.
